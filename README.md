# ImagePainting3

11/10/2023 : This is an early release of the code. I had a ton of feature and push my poor coding skill to the limits....
Only quick test, no real test on the field, this is an unstable version for the moment, but i finally add all the feature i had in mind.

## Introduction

![DSCN1062](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/assets/2498942/7e9e492f-5bf0-4190-b320-43653a29ce49)

New version of [ImagePainting2](https://github.com/jbreizh/ImagePainting2) which was a new version of [ImagePainting](https://github.com/jbreizh/ImagePainting).... 

This version will be the ultimate ImagePainting (no more major feature/breakage) just code stabilization and cosmetic, i have no more ideas...

In this version, i had :

* possibility to save/restore parameter in json file
* possibility to create playlist to enqueue different bitmap with their own parameter
* possibility to save/restore playlist in json file
* possibility to play playlist in one shot or trigger for each bitmap
* possibilty to play the playlist or the current parameter

All this parameter combine with playlist, give a lot creative possibility, but it challenge my poor skill to make everything working together.

## Description

ImagePainting3 is project of a lightPainting device aiming to be powerfull but yet simple and cheap to build and to use. All you need is an USB battery bank, a LED Strip, an ESP8266 board and a smartphone (any device with wifi and a browser).

After a simple [electronic wiring](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/electronic-wiring), adapting the [ESP8266 code](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/ESP8266-code) and finally following the [flash instruction](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/Flash-instruction), you will have a lightPainting device that you can control with your [smartphone](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/User-Manual) to shoot [great picture](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagepainting2/wiki/examples).
