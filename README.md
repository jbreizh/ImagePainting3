# ImagePainting3

## Introduction

New version of [ImagePainting2](https://github.com/jbreizh/imagePainting2) which was a new version of [ImagePainting](https://github.com/jbreizh/ImagePainting).... 

Luckily this version will be the ultimate ImagePainting (no more major feature/breakage) to end this madness as i considere it feature complete.

In this version, i had to think again the API to communicate between the frontend and the backend. So deep change, a lot of rewrite and maybe bug. Nevertheless i pretty satisfy with this new API as it let me introduce a lot of new feature while being simpler and solving some dirty hack i had to use before.

In this version, i push my poor coding skill to the limits and add :

* possibility to save/restore parameter in json file
* possibility to create playlist to enqueue different bitmap with their own parameter
* possibility to save/restore playlist in json file
* possibility to play playlist in one shot or trigger for each bitmap
* possibilty to play the playlist or the current parameter

## Description

ImagePainting3 is project of a lightPainting device aiming to be powerfull but yet simple and cheap to build and to use. All you need is an USB battery bank, a LED Strip, an ESP8266 board and a smartphone (any device with wifi and a browser).

After a simple [electronic wiring](https://github.com/jbreizh/Imagepainting3/wiki/electronic-wiring), adapting the [ESP8266 code](https://github.com/jbreizh/Imagepainting3/wiki/ESP8266-code) and finally following the [flash instruction](https://github.com/jbreizh/Imagepainting3/wiki/Flash-instruction), you will have a lightPainting device that you can control with your [smartphone](https://github.com/jbreizh/Imagepainting3/wiki/User-Manual) to shoot [great picture](https://github.com/jbreizh/Imagepainting3/wiki/examples).
